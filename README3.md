# ASELSAN Stock Prices


## Goal

The goal of this project is to create a ML model which will predict the stock prices.
## Dataset
I have Downloaded this dataset from kaggle website. Here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zlemglsmklkaya/aselsan-stock-prices-20172022

## What Have I Done?

- Imported all the required libraries and dataset for this project.
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualizing different aspects of the dataset.
- Finding number of observations and outliers in the dataset.
- Plotting different attributes of the dataset.
- Creating the Model and Prediction of Price
## Library used:

1. numpy.
2. pandas.
3. matplotlib.
4. seaborn.
5. sklearn
## Visualization and EDA of different attributes:
## Conclusion:

- The variation of Opening Price of "ASELSAN" with Date is plotted.
- Heatmap of "ASELSAN" is shown.
- The decrease in opening price in 2018 to 2020 and the increase from 2020 to 2022 is plotted.
