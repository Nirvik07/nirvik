# Swarm Behaviour Classification


## Goal

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model with highest accuracy, which will classify the behaviour of a swarm
## Dataset
I have Downloaded this dataset from kaggle website. Here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/deepcontractor/swarm-behaviour-classification

## What Have I Done?

- Imported all the required libraries and dataset for this project.
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualizing different aspects of the dataset.
- Finding number of observations and outliers in the dataset.
- Plotting different attributes of the dataset.
- Building the machine learning models.
- Comparing the Models and find out the best one.
## Library used:

1. numpy.
2. pandas.
3. matplotlib.
4. seaborn.
5. plotly.
6. skleran
7. xgboost
## Visualization and EDA of different attributes:
## Conclusion:

- 16 different types ogf ML Models created.
- LGBM Model gave best score.
- Gradient Boosting Classifier Model gave the second best score.
