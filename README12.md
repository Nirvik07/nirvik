# Mobile Price Classification


## Goal

The goal of this project is to analyze mobile phones and create a prediction model to predict the mobile prices.
## Dataset
I have Downloaded this dataset from kaggle website. Here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification

## What Have I Done?

- Imported all the required libraries and dataset for this project.
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualizing different aspects of the dataset.
- Finding number of observations and outliers in the dataset.
- Plotting different attributes of the dataset.
- Implement Machine Learning model
## Library used:

1. numpy.
2. pandas.
3. matplotlib.
4. seaborn.
5. sklearn
6. xgboost
7. lightgbm
## Visualization and EDA of different attributes:
## Conclusion:

- Two models got high scores
- LogisticRegression and MLPClassifier.
- Hyper parameter tunning done for Logistic regression classifier.
- The score of the model matches with the features selection.
