# Electric Motor Temperature Analysis


## Goal

The goal of this project is to analyse the Electric Motor Temperature and create a prediction model by which we can predict the temperature of the motors based on the particular parameters.
## Dataset
I have Downloaded this dataset from kaggle website. Here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wkirgsn/electric-motor-temperature

## What Have I Done?

- Imported all the required libraries and dataset for this project.
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualizing different aspects of the dataset.
- Finding number of observations and outliers in the dataset.
- Plotting different attributes of the dataset.
- 8 different Models are created for prediction of temperature.
## Library used:
1. numpy.
2. pandas.
3. matplotlib.
4. seaborn.
5. sklearn
6. xgboost
7. lightgbm
8. tensorflow
## Visualization and EDA of different attributes:
## Conclusion:
- Heatmap of the Dataset is shown.
- Variation of frequency with All of the columns.
- 8 Models are created.
- LinearRegression Algorithm and Ridge Regression Algorithm gave the best predicted score.
